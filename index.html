                Self-improvement is not about becoming perfect.
                It is about becoming better than yesterday.
                As a student, I realized that small habits can create big changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, struggles, and lessons
                related to discipline, focus, and personal growth.
            </p>

                Even slow progress is still progress.
