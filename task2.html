        <p>
            Online learning has become an important part of education in recent years.
            It allows students to learn from anywhere using digital devices and the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            One major benefit of online learning is flexibility. Students can manage
            their own schedules and learn at a comfortable pace.
        </p>

        <p>
            Online platforms provide video lectures, notes, quizzes, and practice
            materials which help in better understanding of concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also cost-effective and reduces travel time, making education
            accessible to students from different backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, online learning encourages self-learning and helps students
            prepare for future career opportunities.
